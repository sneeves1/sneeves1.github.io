# Overview
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, “Mental illnesses are common in the United States. Nearly one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness (52.9 million in 2020). Mental illnesses include many different conditions that vary in degree of severity, ranging from mild to moderate to severe.” While those who suffer from a mental illness should seek medical
attention, there are a few practices to improve symptoms. These practices include exercising, eating a healthy diet, and being physically active. But what about money? Can making more money affect mental health? This project aims to look at the spatial distribution of adults over 18 who experience 14 or more bad mental health days, and compare it with: data on adults who sleep less than 7 hours, data on adults who report having no time for leisure activity, and lastly data on median household income. This project also aims to assess potential areas that may be at risk of experiencing poor mental health days. This project looks at data for Baltimore, Maryland.

# Conclusion and Findings
As the data shows, there is a strong correlation between adults who have had 14 or more bad mental health days compared toreports of lack of sleep, and exercise. Median household income also correlates with poor mental health days. When looking at the median household income map and the 14 or more bad mental health day maps, you can see that two maps are almost the inverse of each other. This shows that areas that make less money, also have more bad mental health days. The risk map shows that areas who are already experiencing the highest amount of bad mental health days are also at higher risk of experiencing bad mental health days.
