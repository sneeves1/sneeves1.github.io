## Project 1: Introduction to QGIS

**Description:** This map was the first ever map made using QGIS. Data was acquired through https://bniajfi.org/ to find data on the percent of households in Baltimore City without internet at home. In QGIS, I used the data to show a simple time series from 2017 to 2019 to show changes in the percent of households without internet. The main purpose of making this map was to practice new ways to visualize data. What I learned through making this map is how to 1) make the area of interest "pop out" of the map in a semi 3-D way, and 2) visualize the Inner Harbor and other water features the way it is shown in this map. One thing I would like to change about these maps is I would like to visualize the data on the same scale, so that change can be better visualized. As you can see in my legend, the scales differ from one another, making it hard to compare the three maps.
