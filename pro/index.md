## Project 1: Introduction to QGIS

**Description:** This map was the first ever map made using QGIS. Data was acquired through https://bniajfi.org/ to find data on the percent of households in BAltimore City without internet at home. In QGIS, I used the data to show a simple time series from 2017 to 2019 to show changes in the percent of households without internet.
