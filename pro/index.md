## Project 1: Introduction to QGIS

**Description:** This map was the first ever map made using QGIS. Data was acquired through https://bniajfi.org/ to find data on the percent of households in Baltimore City without internet at home. This data displays data on the coummunity statistical area level. In QGIS, I used the data to show a simple time series from 2017 to 2019 to show changes in the percent of households without internet. The main purpose of making this map was to practice new ways to visualize data. What I learned through making this map is how to 1) make the area of interest "pop out" of the map in a semi 3-D way, and 2) visualize the Inner Harbor and other water features the way it is shown in this map. I am really pleased with how these maps turned out, and it is also nice to see that the percent of households without internet access per community statistical area has decreased across the three year span
