 09/15/2022  - This map was created by me in September 2022. Unemployment has its challenges, and I have not been immune to them. As a goal oriented person, I wanted to create a project to work on that would allow me to continue using my GIS skills and to possibly learn more skills in the process. This project was created for this exact reason. The River's Edge Trails is a trail system located in Brunswick, Maryland and is home to a wide variety of mountain biking and hiking trails. This trail system is one I hold dear to my heart, as these are the trails that help introduce me to mountain biking, a past time I enjoy to this day. The original trail map created for this area was created in (I believe) 2019/2020. Since then, multiple trails have been added to the system, but the map has not been updated. My goal was to make an updated map. 
  
 
  I walked the trails with the Strava app on my phone to collect the trail data. Strava has proven to be a surpringly good app to use as a GPS. The free version of this app allows one to record the data of their routes, and export them as a .gpx file which can then be converted to a shape file. I like using Strava because it is free and worked well under the tree cover of the woods that River's Edge is located in. 
    
 
  One the trail data was collected, the track point data was brought in to QGIS to be edited. Like any GPS, Strava did have some issues at such a fine scale, so the points needed to be cleaned up. I then used the "Points to Path" tool to create the trails on the map. Contour line data was found on the Frederick County, MD government website in their GIS data portal. 
   
   
  One issue that arose in this project was adding a hillshade layer. I wanted to add this to create a 3D effect, but this was presenting a challenge. in the Maryland government GIS data portal, they have LiDAR data of each county. The problem was when downloading the LiDAR data, the TIFF file would lose its spatial reference and would not be projected. Even looking at the metadata to see the original projection proved useless. I was not able to correctly project this rasterthorugh this method, but I did find a workaround. Instead of downloading the data and bringing it in to QGIS, I looked through the metadata and found a way to call the data in as a WMS. For the purpose of this project where the hillshade acts as a basemap, this worked perfectly.
    
    
  Now that the map is finalized, I exported it, and posted it here. I really enjoyed this project as it allowed me to hone skills I already have, as well as learm new skills. It was also nice to get to walk the trails in my hometown.
