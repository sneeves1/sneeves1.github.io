 10/01/2022 - This map was created by me in September 2022. I wanted to create a project to work on that would allow me to continue using my GIS skills, to possibly learn more skills in the process, and to possibly use my skills and passions to help serve my community. As an avid mountain biker, I enjoy riding at the River's Edge trails. I remembered back through the past 2 or so years, and thought about how so many trails have been built since the current map at that time was made. These trails are a staple in our community and has really boosted attraction to the outdoors community. Thus, this project was created. This project allowed me to intersect my passions and skills to help serve my community.
  
 
  I walked the trails with the Strava app on my phone to collect the trail data. Strava has proven to be a surpringly good app to use as a GPS. The free version of this app allows one to record the data of their routes, and export them as a .gpx file which can then be converted to a shape file. I like using Strava because it is free and worked well under the tree cover of the woods that River's Edge is located in. 
    
 
  Once the trail data was collected, the track point data was brought in to QGIS to be edited. Like any GPS, Strava did have some issues at such a fine scale, so the points needed to be cleaned up. I then used the point data to create the trail lines on the map. Contour line data was found on the Frederick County, MD government website in their GIS data portal. 
   
    
  Once a rough draft was created, I sent it to the trail founder/builder, and he wanted to use it! The two of us worked together to make a finalized product. The finalized product included logos from all of the businesses who have shown support for the trails, and adding the Park SMART safety announcement. These were added/created through the use of InkScape, which is a free graphic design software. I really enjoyed this project as it allowed me to hone skills I already have, learn new skills, and lastly and most importantly use my skills to serve my community.

  11/14/23 - This map has been edited to include the new section of trails that was built in the summner of 2023. Also, per customer request, the symbology of the down hill trails were changed to white as to not confuse the many trails with similar colors.
