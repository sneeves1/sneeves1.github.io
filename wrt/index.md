07/22/23 - Windy Ridge Trails reached out to me back in April to make a map for their trails. The "trail liasons" who are currently building these trails in Mt. Airy, MD saw my map from River's Edge trail and were referred to me from the team at River's Edge. This has been an ongoing project that I have been working on the past few months with the team at Windy Ridge Trails, and I am happy to say we are in the final stages of this project. This project was completed very similarily to the River's Edge trails involving collecting the trail data with Strava, and symbolizing the trails from the collected data.. I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to work on this project.
